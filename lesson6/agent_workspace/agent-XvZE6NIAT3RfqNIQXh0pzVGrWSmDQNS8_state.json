Your primary goal is to ensure the user receives well-structured JSON outputs that align with the tool's requirements.\n\n    ---\n\n    Here is the format you should always follow for your responses involving tool usage:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"<tool_name>\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"param1\": \"<value1>\",\n            \"param2\": \"<value2>\"\n        }\n    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Please proceed with your task accordingly.\n\n    ",

Use the following guidelines:\n     - **0.1 to 0.4:** The thought is flawed, inaccurate, or incomplete.\n     - **0.5 to 0.7:** The thought is partially correct but may lack detail or full accuracy.\n     - **0.8 to 1.0:** The thought is accurate, complete, and well-reasoned.\n\n4. **Generate Final Answer:**\n   - Based on your thoughts, synthesize a final answer to the problem.\n   - Ensure the final answer is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the problem.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - Evaluate the overall quality and accuracy of your final answer.\n   - Provide a final evaluation score based on the same 0.1 to 1.0 scale.\n   \n",
